## Shiny App: Launch Metrics: 2024 Dodgers-Padres Playoff Series
This app examines the launch metrics in a baseball series. The app lets users filter observations by game date, pitcher, batter, and event type. Clicking on a point shows the associated [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) video.

## Closeread Article submitted to the [Closeread Prize](https://posit.co/blog/closeread-prize-announcement/)
After building the [Launch Metrics Shiny app](https://axelkent.shinyapps.io/LaunchMetricsApp/), I put together an interactive article featuring the app. To retell a story of the series, users will scroll and see a series of interactive plots that highlight patterns of balls in play and key series events.
